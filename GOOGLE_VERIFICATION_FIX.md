3. **Test Again**

## ‚úÖ Solution 2: Publish App & Get Verified (For Public Release)

### Steps:

1. **Prepare OAuth Consent Screen**

## üéØ Recommended Approach

### For Now (Development/Testing):
‚úÖ **Use Solution 1** - Add test users
- Fast (works immediately)
- Perfect for beta testing
- No verification needed
- Can add up to 100 users

### For Later (Public Launch):
‚úÖ **Use Solution 2** - Get verified
- Required for public app
- Allows unlimited users

---

## üìù Required Documents for Verification

If you go with Solution 2, you'll need:

### 1. Privacy Policy
Create a page explaining:
- What data you collect (email, profile, health data)
- How you use it (risk assessment, weather correlation)
- Where it's stored (user's Google Drive)
- How users can delete it (export/delete in settings)

### 2. Terms of Service
Create a page explaining:
- App is not medical advice
- User responsibilities
- Disclaimer about health information
- Account termination policy

### 3. YouTube Video Demo
- 1-2 minute video showing:
  - Sign in with Google
  - Onboarding flow
  - Main features
  - How scopes are used
  - Where data is stored

---

## üîç Why Google Requires This

Google protects users by verifying apps that:
- Access sensitive data (Drive, Sheets)
- Use OAuth for authentication
- Are publicly available

Your app requests these **sensitive scopes**:
- ‚úÖ `drive.file` - Access to Drive files
- ‚úÖ `spreadsheets` - Access to Google Sheets

This triggers verification requirements.

---

## üí° Alternative: Reduce Scope Requirements

If you don't want to go through verification, you could:

1. **Remove Google OAuth entirely**
   - Use local storage only
   - No cloud sync
   - Simpler but less features

2. **Use different backend**
   - Firebase (still needs verification)
   - Supabase (no Google verification)
   - Traditional database

But these defeat the purpose of your privacy-first, Google Drive-based architecture! üòä
